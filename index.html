          <p>
            My name is Jae, I’m a web developer and UX designer from Seattle. I’m really good with people, my mom says I’m the best actually, so it was only fitting that I pursue a career that focuses on meeting the needs of people. That’s the UX part of my skills, finding what users want and creating beautiful, simple designs. The development skills come from my affinity to technical problem solving. It’s great, having the ability to design and execute all at the tip of my fingers. Please hire me.

            I like to work on cars, when I work on something new in the car new tools are almost always needed. Some are easier than other, some more useful than others, but each serves its own purpose. These are the tools that I’ve picked up over my career developing and designing. Click on the icons to check out what each technology means to me and what impact it’s had on my career.

          <h2>Javascript: The Language of the Web</h2>
          <p>
            The most recent coding language that I've added to my toolbelt. JavaScript is my favorite language its simple to use (in my perspective), and is the primary language for the web. It’s funny because you always start out trying to optimize and learn a language that’s the perfect fit for you, but for web that decision is already made for you. Of course, there’s TypeScript and other *ahem* no name coding languages for the web (kidding) but JavaScript is the most popular and with the most support. 9.5/10 Would code with again.

          <p>
            Oh, Cascading Style Sheets, why the f are you so complicated and frustrating at times. You know, you write some CSS without looking at the output and in your head, you think you know what’s going to output, but then you look and it’s like what the f is on my screen. I had a difficult time wrapping my head around CSS especially how hard it is to align elements vertically before flexbox and grid. How the heck does that make any sense. I feel bad for developers that wrote stylesheets before this new age of markup. 5.7/10 Would code again only because it’s the only option.

          <h2>HTML: *pushes up glasses* Actually it's not a 'coding' language'</h2>
          <p>
            It’s pretty simple, I have to admit HTML isn’t bad at all. If only I could remember how to connect style sheets or JavaScript code. It’s always funny to see your browser history fill up with ‘how to link css html’. HTML is great, it’s not difficult to understand, and easy to see structure using tabs. 8/10 Would code again because of ease of use.

            This was the language I wrote my first full stack website with, which you can check out below. Python is a great language for beginners, its simple, syntactically straightforward yada yada yada, I’m just repeating what other people say. Sometimes I like it sometimes I don’t, its pretty loose with a lot of things. I was a TA for a python course, check the experience section. 7.3/10 Would code again because it’s so quick.

          <h2>C#: Thank you for your help in my growth as a developer!</h2>
          <p>
            Ahh, C#, Microsoft’s Java. It’s the first language I used in my professional career, and it was a delight to use. This is mainly due to Visual Studio being so great. Although it’s a pretty heavy software and isn’t the most user friendly, its feature set is robust and made coding at times a lot easier. Right click and you’ll see a bunch of shortcuts. C# was my first experience using interfaces and the SOLID design principals (which I don’t completely understand yet). Its syntax is almost the same as Java, so the transition was easy, and I have no complaints with it. 8.5/10 Would code again for Visual Studio.

            Great server-side runtime that I would use over Python if it’s light. I like JavaScript so using it to run the backend is nice. I’m not that versed with function programming so it’s a little more difficult to code complex systems, but it’s not for that. 8/10 Would code in again.

            You would think collaboration and cloud storage would be a simpler task, but it’s not. Git has a pretty steep learning curve IMO. So many times, where I just nuked that repo and re-cloned it. After getting to use git using GitKraken and in Visual Studio it became much more user friendly and made a lot more sense.

When you’re on the outside you think that under the hood of the programs you use it’s some super complex mechanism that making things work, some database stuff, but underneath it’s just a bunch of tables.

            Figma is my go-to wireframing tool, it’s simple to use and collaboration is easy between team members. To be completely honest I don’t wireframe on devices too often, I prefer to use paper and pencil to sketch out ideas.  7.5/10 Would use again for collaboration.

            Fun fact when the class I took, Visual Design, the instructor didn’t know how to use Illustrator when it was the required tool. I remember asking the instructor how to align something to a key object and she responded that she didn’t know and that it was my job to figure out, thanks, I’ll also go spend $1,500 to talk to a wall, I guess. Anyways, Illustrator has a really steep learning curve that made me want to pull out my hair at times, but once you know how to use all the features you need, it’s a pretty simple to use. The only barrier now becomes the designs you can make, which mine are great. 8/10 Would use again because there’s nothing that is better.

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>
                  To develop a front-end portfolio that showcases my works as a developer and designer and to exercise my design skills.

              <p>
                Creating design requirements was an easy task since there wasn’t any user research needed. Showcasing my relevant experience simply had to be beautiful and direct the user to the most important parts. These design requirements were crucial through the design process, for every new addition I came back to these requirements to ensure that I was following the guidelines I had set out.

                <h3>Clear Hierarchy </h3>
                <p>
                  The website needs to have clear hierarchy to guide the user to the most important parts of the website. This is also necessary to enhance readability for the user.

                  White space must be managed carefully to maintain readability. More white space is better than less, do not squish elements too close to each other. Chunks or sections are spaced further apart than headings to body.

                I created wireframes to start the design process, but I wasn’t very specific on element positioning, white space, or hierarchy. I wanted to create a general layout and iterate multiple times since I knew it was going to be a process of designing and redesigning. These wireframes only took about 30 minutes to draw up, then I started the development process.
