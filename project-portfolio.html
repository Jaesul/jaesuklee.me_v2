                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                  This project was to develop my skills as a front-end developer and to showcase my experience and projects. I also leveraged my design background to create a beautiful, yet simplistic layout, and maintain visual hierarchy and usability. 
                </p>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  I don’t have a central location to showcase my personal experiences and qualifications. I also don’t have a solid front end project under my belt.
                </p>
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>
                  To develop a front-end portfolio that showcases my works as a developer and designer and to exercise my design skills.

              <h2>Creating Design Requirements </h2>
              <h4>Guidelines for designing </h4>
              <p>
                Creating design requirements was an easy task since there wasn’t any user research needed. Showcasing my relevant experience simply had to be beautiful and direct the user to the most important parts. These design requirements were crucial through the design process, for every new addition I came back to these requirements to ensure that I was following the guidelines I had set out.

                <h3>Clear Hierarchy </h3>
                <p>
                  The website needs to have clear hierarchy to guide the user to the most important parts of the website. This is also necessary to enhance readability for the user.

                  Don’t stick to one static, keep redesigning until the desired product is created. If the whole thing needs to be thrown out, then do what’s necessary.

                  White space must be managed carefully to maintain readability. More white space is better than less, do not squish elements too close to each other. Chunks or sections are spaced further apart than headings to body.

              <p>          
                I created wireframes to start the design process, but I wasn’t very specific on element positioning, white space, or hierarchy. I wanted to create a general layout and iterate multiple times since I knew it was going to be a process of designing and redesigning. These wireframes only took about 30 minutes to draw up, then I started the development process.

                <h2>First Iterations of Layout</h2>
                <p>
                  I took the dive and started developing the portfolio. This was when I realized that I didn’t have all the front-end developer skills that I needed. Well then what did I do? I went along and coded what I could do, to see what I needed to work on. The top left was my first attempt, it wasn’t terrible, but I didn’t know any flexbox or proper element placing which is crucial for consistent document flow and proper white spacing. Each box going right then down is a new iteration, and as I progressed and picked up new skills, I was able to better position and space elements.

              <p>
                Some may call me a narcissist, but I think I just like the work I create. I’m no stranger to holding onto designs that aren’t great and thinking that they’ll work. To avoid this, I went around to my design friends and presented them with my work, and they let me know what to fix. Most of their critiques were about small things, text that didn’t make sense, grammatical issues etc. Here are some quotes from them 
              </p>
              <div class="info-card">
                <blockquote>

              <h2>Refinement -The Difficult stage</h2>
              <p>
                I felt like I had the start to the design I was looking for, but I felt as if things needed to change. This was by far the most difficult stage. I kept throwing around designs, but I couldn’t get a consistent enough design language that I was comfortable calling the final iteration. After receiving critique and working on different projects that gave me more development skills, I went back to do further refinements to the design. I decided to take some radical changes in some parts like the footer and the projects sections. 
              </p>
              <h3>Before</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/portfolio/main-before.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <h3>After</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/portfolio/main-after.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                I fixed the whitespace, positioned the text to center, and adjusted font weight and size. This helped with the readability and gave better balance to the main page. 
              </p>
              <h3>Before</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/portfolio/projects-before.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <h3>After</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/portfolio/projects-after.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                The projects container went through drastic changes. I didn’t like how the user had to hover over the container to read the details. The color contrast of the projects with the main splash was too visually stimulating and unbalanced the design. I went for a simpler approach with fewer projects to better balance the section and create more harmony.

              <h2>Adding Javascript </h2>
              <p>
                JavaScript was the easiest part of development. I knew I wanted to add animations and transitions to spice up the flow of the website, so I just had to choose which containers and what transitions I wanted to implement. There were two difficult parts to the JavaScript, Intersection Observers, and creating the nav bar. 
              </p>
              <h3>Intersection Observers</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/experience/bluetooth.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                The intersection observer was difficult because of it’s interesting method of padding, margins, and thresholds. The nomenclature was a little bit weird, but I got the hang of it eventually. In the next refactor I want to query the specific containers based on a umbrella search for a class. This way it’ll clean up the JavaScript when querying the document. 
              </p>
              <h3>Nav Bar</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/experience/bluetooth.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                The navbar gave me so much trouble and still does. First was figuring out how to keep the navbar down on scroll. My design was that the user could scroll down from the landing page and the nav bar would disappear. If the user scrolled up the navbar would reappear and persist if the user’s mouse was hovering over the container. I figured out how to keep the navbar down by using mouse enter on the div and used timeouts to transition the nav bar away. Unfortunately the nav bar still has issues reappearing when scrolling back to the top which I am still working on.
              </p>
              <h3>Sliding Transitions</h3>
              <div class="full-img-container">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <img src="imgs/experience/bluetooth.png" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                The sliding transitions give the page a lot of life. I added them where I saw fit with mostly slides and fade in and fade out. These additions were also given to modals, buttons, and page transitions. These were the transitions I felt were the cleanest and provided an extra dimension of fluidity.
